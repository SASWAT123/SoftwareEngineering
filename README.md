The goal of this project is to take a working system (written in LUA) and write it in any other language. The programming language we chose is JAVA.

This repository contains solution for the tasks of HW2, HW3, HW4, HW5 as listed below:

|Homework| Task|
|:------:|:------|
|HW2     | Implementation for the `Num` and `Sym` class and the tests cases `the`, `sym`, `num`, `bignum`.|
|HW3     | Implementation for the `Cols`, `Row`, `Data` class and the test cases `eg.csv, eg.data, eg.stats`.|
|HW4     | Add all the bling from [HW1](https://github.com/txt/se22/blob/main/docs/hw1.md). Also, add post-commit hooks to auto run all the test cases, the code coverage checks (if your language supports then), and the documentation generators.|
|HW5     | For five other groups from cs510, apply the Project1 [rubric](https://github.com/txt/se22/blob/main/docs/proj1.md#rubric).|

To view the src code, go to the src/main/java/  
Here you can access different classes for Num, Sym, Cols, Row, Data in the package com.se.homeworktwo

To run the testcases, go to the test package located inside src/main/java/ and run the Eg.java file.
